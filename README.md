# GPA Calculator Project

## Simple GPA Tracker and Calculator


A project designed as an aid to students to track their cumulative GPA and perform calculations that can help with 
future course planning. I thought this would be an interest project to undergo as the Grade Summary page on UBC's
student services centre misses many features.
